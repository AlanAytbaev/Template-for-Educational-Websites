	<p>
	Take, for example, two hydrogen atoms of identical isotope, and therefore, equal attractive force between nucleus and electron. When brought close enough
	to one another, the electrons of each atom will become influenced by the attractive force from the other's nucleus and its' own. This forms an attractive
	force between both hydrogen atoms' positively-charged nuclei, and negatively-charged electrons; if this force equals the repelling forces between both hydrogen atoms' nuclei,
    it will form a chemical bond. In this chemical bond, both nuclei are at a state of equilibrium, yet vibrate in place. This is the most common bond 
	between two atoms - the Hydrogen Bond.

	<div class="contentHeading" align="center">What Constitutes a Covalent Bond?</div>
	<p>
	The covalent bond maintains the equal sharing of valence electrons by each atom forming the bond. This is due to an equal <span title ="A measure of attractive force
	between electron and nucleus"><u>electronegativity</u></span> in both atoms. The ball-and-stick model that represents a covalent bond is accurate because both nuclei
	face a certain direction in space, relative to the angle of their bond, which is represented by a stick. Often, however, the electronegativity of two atoms are not
	identical, which leads to an unequal sharing of electrons between two atoms. To categorize these different types of covalent bonds, the terms polar and nonpolar are used.

	<p>
	Covalent bonding is not limited to the monogomy of just two electrons. Dual and Triple bonds refer to instances in which two atoms share 4 and 6 electrons, respectively, in
	a covalent bond. Carbon is known to form triple bonds with itself, and Nitrogen forms the single strongest bond between two identical elements with a triple bond. Carbon is known
	to form quadruple bonds with itself. Despite the higher number of bonded electrons, the fourth bond is only 15% as strong as the first three, as bond energy gets weaker for every
	electron pair included. This example of dicarbon bonding is the limit of s and p-block atoms, which only have the electrons to make a maximum of 8 electrons bond.
	<br>
	<br>	
	Further down the periodic table, transition metals have been seen to form quadruple bonds with stable elements, such as chromium and tungsten. Quintuple and hextuple bonds exist as well,
	yet the strength of their bond levels decreases heavily. Dititanium and dichromium have been shown to form hextuple bonds with themselves, the latter forming the highly uncommon
	quintuple bond. The stability of these bonds, however, is in question, as with all other high electron-count bonds.
