	<p>
	Chemical bonds have existed in theory since the start of the Common Era.
	A well-known example of this is Lucretius(c. 95-c. 55b.c.), the author of <i>De Rurum Natura</i>, 
	which translates to "on the nature of things". Lucretius describes atoms as tiny spheres with arms akin to fishooks.
	This, he believed, allowed them to latch-on and combine with one another, similar to modern-day velcro.
	<br>
	<br>
	Further mention of chemical bonds existed during the 12th century. Thinkers noted that
	some <span title="Atoms, molecules, molecular fragments, ions, et cetera"><u>chemical species</u></span> had a possible
	<span title="The electronic property by which different chemical species are capable of bonding into chemical compounds"><u>chemical affinity.</u></span>
	This led Isaac Newton to write in <i>Opticks</i> that "particles attract one another by some force, which in immediate 
	contact is exceedingly strong, at small distances performs the chemical operations, and reaches not far from the particles with any sensible effect.", which
	was an early hypothesis on the attractive forces between the nucleus and nearby electrons.

	<div class="contentHeading" align = "center">Compound or Allotrope?</div>
	<p>
	While compounds and allotropes may be similar in that they consist of atoms that have bonded together, allotropes
	are made up of only one type of element that is bonded to itself in a certain arrangement. Examples of these are
	carbon nanotubes, and carbon buckyballs. Compounds display chemical and physical properties, based on the elements
	that form them, which are not found in allotropes.

	<div class="contentHeading" align = "center">Molecule and Formula Unit.</div>
	<p>
	A <b>molecule</b> refers to two or more elements that are covalently bonded. The type of bonding, whether polar or nonpolar, is irrelevant.
	<br>
	<br>
	A <b>formula unit</b> indicates the lowest whole number ratio of ions in an ionic compound. Ionic compounds cannot be classified as molecules
	because they are arranged in a crystal lattice, therefore they lack a discrete particle-entity which is characteristic in molecules.
