	Polar covalent bonds undermine the sharing of electrons that categorizes covalence. In such a bond, one or more electrons are shared unequally between the nuclei they
	orbit. The "dominant" atom is the one which has a higher electronegativity, and thus attracts foreign electrons with more force than said electrons' nucleus.

	Polar covalent bonds most often in the formation of <span title="A collection of well-bonded atoms"><u>molecules</u></span>. These molecules form an <span title ="An electric system in which the positive and negative charges are separate."><u>electric dipole</u></span> In a hydrogen-fluoride bond, the fluoride has a higher electronegativity, which
	leads to the shared electrons to be more likely found in the fluoride atom rather than in the hydrogen atom. Since electrons are negatively charged, the fluoride end of the molecule
	is more negatively-charged than the hydrogen end. These differences in charge within a molecule cause weak but present intermolecular forces, as positively and negatively charged ends
	make haste to align with one another. These forces give molecular compounds, especially those of organic nature, their surface tension, solubility, boiling and melting points, and physical
	character, such as softness and bulk. Not all polar covalent molecules are dipoles. For example, carbon dioxide has a linear distribution of charge, resulting in no apparent separation of
	positive and negatively-charged polar extremities. The same can be said about boron trifluoride.
